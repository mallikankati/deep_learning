## Deep Learning algorithms

 Implemented following DP algorithms using Keras, tensorflow, sklearn, pandas and numpy in python
 
 Highly recommend Udemy Deep Learning course by [SuperDataScience Team](https://www.udemy.com/deeplearning/). They have step by step examples to understand Deep Learning

These blog posts helped me understand Neural Networks with backprop
